# JavaScript
FNB APP Academy week 4 
Hi,



Welcome to Week 4 and the start of the Intermediate level of the FNB App Academy!

In the beginner level, you learnt how to build apps using html and bring them to life using css. We ended up the beginner level by building two complete apps from the ground up! You should be fairly comfortable with using these two languages by now. But I’m sure you’ve noticed by now that the projects you’ve built, while beautiful, are quite static. They don’t have any deeper functionality or uses, other than just displaying information.



It’s time to change that. We’re going to kick things up a notch and add a third language to the mix, JavaScript. The final sibling in the HTML5 family. JavaScript is used to add functionality to your HTML pages like adding a handler to manage form submissions, or performing calculations or even building entire videos games!



This week, we’ll work on teaching you the very basics of JavaScript. It’s going to be a little confusing at first, but hang in there! You’ve made it this far, you got this!

We’ve also got some exciting lectures coming up. You’ll learn valuable skills like:

APIs, Data Input and Processing

User Centric App Development

Data Management and Analysis

Business Development



Let’s dive in!
